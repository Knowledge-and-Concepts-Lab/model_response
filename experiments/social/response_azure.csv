"""How would someone from a small town respond to the question: ""Who am I?""","""Why am I here?"" I thought of Christ, and how he answered those same questions for his followers. Of course, I would not be a great teacher or philosopher or preacher like Christ, but I could follow his example, by relying on the good that already exists here on earth. 126.303 We have a pretty tight schedule, so I started off by teaching only one or two hours per day, but soon I found myself making opportunities to work with every one who came around, even if it meant sacrificing some of my much-needed sleep. I gradually increased my hours of direct interaction with the group, learning from their feedback and adapting my approach along the way. And in just three months time, I was rewarded with the chance to teach the small town of Pewaukee again. 126.311 By the end of the year, I had formed a strong bond with the small town and its residents. I had learned to love them, and they had learned to love me. Even though we detected no exact match between our genetics, there was still a bond between us, a bond of shared experiences and common goals. With my curiosity for life, and with the help of a great group of people, I managed to make the most of my time in Pewaukee,",Pewaukee

"Write statements that best explain who you are (but don't spend more than a few words on each statement).""","(from How to Write a Statement of Purpose)  Think up 2-3 life experiences to include in your essay that help answer essay 1.  Some possible guiding questions for brainstorming:  What is it about architecture/design that draws you in?  Do you have any personal experiences that relate to architectural space (whether it is visiting places, reading about architecture, helping with construction/renovation projects, etc.)?  Do you feel strongly about any crisis or social issue related to built environment (i.e. ""gentrification"", affordable housing crisis, sustainable development)? Do you have personal experience with these issues that made you interested in architecture?  Is there anyone in your life (family members, friends) who influenced your decision to study architecture/design in a significant way?  Did you have to overcome any obstacle or adversity that helped shape your identity as a person and/or an architect/history/theory critic?  How to structure essay 2:  It's a good idea to pull out specific words and phrases from your list(s) of life experiences and qualities and use them to write anecdotes that illustrate them.  For example, if you listed ""seeking justice"" as one of your qualities, then you could write about how you spent a summer volunteering for an organization that helps refugees find affordable and safe housing",housin

What are the qualities of a good life? How would someone from a small town answer that question?,"Would someone who makes it big in one of America’s largest cities have a different answer?  These are just a few of the types of questions we love to explore on this podcast since each person’s experience of life is unique. We are all influenced by our environment, our experiences, and the people we meet. Kristen Casey is a great example of this, having moved from Ohio (more specifically Cleveland) to New York City to follow her love of dance. As you can  When most of us think about wanting more wealth, we usually picture ourselves being idle, lounging by the pool and drinking margaritas all day. In reality, though, wealth is not so much about having more time than money but about having control over one’s own life so that work is an option rather than a necessity. In other words, it is about having the freedom to pursue one’s passions.  That’s what today’s guest is all about. Meet David Pere, a real estate inv  Communication is key in every relationship, whether it’s personal or professional. Without effective communication, relationships can break down rapidly, and it is not always the fault of one person. To have healthy relationships, all parties involved must put in effort. The same principle applies to business partners. You’ve probably heard",hear
What are the qualities of a good life? How would someone from a big city answer that question?,"Someone from the countryside? Someone who has never lived near a city? A 15-year-old? Your grandmother? These are just some of the questions we’ve explored using Google’s creative search tools with the Thinking Lens, a resource we designed to help educators support critical thinking and digital literacy skills in their students.  Thinking Lens is inspired by the “four Cs” of 21st century learning: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. These skills are essential for students of all ages and backgrounds, and will help them thrive as they approach higher education and their future careers.  The tool was created for grade 6-12 teachers and students, but could also be useful for anyone looking to add some fun and creativity to their open web searches.  With its built-in guides, Thinking Lens helps users explore questions through the lenses of perspective, evidence, and context. Here’s a quick primer on what each of these lenses means:  Perspective: Explore different ways to look at a topic. What are some other perspectives you haven’t thought about? How might your perspective be different from someone else’s?  Evidence: Find reliable sources of information and critically evaluate them. Where is the information coming from? Can you trust the source?  Context: Consider the bigger picture behind a topic. When",Whe
What qualities are important when thinking about what makes for a good spouse? How would someone from a small town answer that question?,"What about an immigrant? A New Yorker? We know one way to find out: Ask them.  Over the last few months, through a partnership with StoryCorps, we’ve been capturing these conversations across America, hearing different perspectives on what makes a strong relationship from people from different walks of life. We’ve met a couple who talked about how they make their marriage work despite having opposite viewpoints on political issues; another pair who spoke about how they fell in love after an accidental meeting at Walmart; and a widow who spoke with her son about how she fell in love with his father.  Today, for Valentine’s Day, here are five more stories about finding love and making it last.  1. A couple of kids from very different backgrounds: Sheri and Michael Frantz grew up with very different families, and when they met in high school it had the makings of a Romeo and Juliet story. Their parents had one thing in common, though: Both sets of kids didn't feel loved by their parents. That sense of abandonment formed a strong bond. From Sheri's perspective, her relationship works because they're both “wounded survivors.”  2. A commitment to each other, and words of love: Ruthie Joffe-Block and Daniel Hernandez met in college and",an
What qualities are important when thinking about what makes for a good spouse? How would someone from a big city answer that question?,"Would someone from a rural area give a different answer?  People with different backgrounds might not only have different answers to these questions, but also different priorities. Some might value financial stability or ambition, while others prioritize kindness. A person’s culture, religious background, family history, socioeconomic status, the region they live in, and a myriad of other factors could all influence what he or she thinks makes for a good spouse. And since everyone’s background and life experiences are unique, it’s impossible to speak universally about what makes someone a good spouse.  Why do we bother trying, then?  I’m an English literature major, so white middle-class Americans from the 19th and early 20th centuries are my area of expertise. And from my readings of novels and conduct books and biographies—whether we’re talking about Thomas Jefferson or Louisa May Alcott—it’s clear that people have always been trying to articulate what makes for a good marriage partner. This is especially true in societies that enforced strict gender roles—for example, keeping women at home to manage households while men worked outside. People in these societies created elaborate systems to know how to attract, court, and marry people with similar backgrounds and values.  For an example of how shared values made marriage easier in the 19th-century",19th-centur
